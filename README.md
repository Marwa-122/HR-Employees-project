# 🧑‍💼 HR Analytics Project – Python, SQL, Tableau

## 📘 Overview

This HR analytics project explores employee data to uncover insights related to attrition, performance, demographics, and workplace dynamics. The project is built in multiple stages using Python, SQL, and Tableau for a complete end-to-end data analysis pipeline.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 🔹 Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Exploration (Python)
- Handled missing values and inconsistent data types.
- Explored distributions (age, gender, education, job role).
- Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Key techniques: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

### 🔹 Phase 2: Advanced Analysis & Feature Engineering (Python)
- Analyzed attrition correlations (overtime, distance, manager experience).
- Created new features:
  - Tenure buckets
  - Manager experience levels
  - Attrition risk flags
- Performed basic classification prep using label encoding.

### 🔹 Phase 3: Querying with SQL *(In Progress)*
- Upload cleaned data to a relational database (e.g. MySQL/PostgreSQL).
- Run queries to answer business questions:
  - Which department has the highest attrition?
  - What’s the average tenure by job role?
  - How does education level affect salary?

### 🔹 Phase 4: Dashboarding (Upcoming – Tableau)
- Build a visual HR dashboard with KPIs like:
  - Attrition Rate
  - Employee Distribution
  - Average Years at Company
  - Department-wise Insights

## 🧠 Key Insights (So Far)

- High attrition observed among employees with frequent business travel.
- Employees with <2 years under the same manager are more likely to leave.
- Certain departments like Sales show consistently higher turnover rates.
